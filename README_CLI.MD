I'll search for information about Nexus network zkvm L1 and their tutorial content to help you create a comprehensive tutorial for new users.Now let me search for the specific Nexus 101 blog content to complement the tutorial.# Nexus Network zkVM L1 Tutorial for New Users
Based on the information from the Nexus 101 blog series and official documentation, here's a comprehensive tutorial to get you started with the Nexus network:
What is Nexus?
Nexus is building the world supercomputer powered by the Nexus Layer 1 blockchain and Nexus zkVM to enable the Verifiable Internet and prove everything from AI to identity. Nexus runs a zkVM inside every node on the blockchain and orchestrates them to work together as one. The L1 gets more powerful with every node that connects and every new release of our zkVM, creating a platform purpose-built for agentic interaction.
Key Components
1. Nexus zkVM
The Nexus zero-knowledge virtual machine is a modular, extensible, prover-optimized, fully-specified zkVM written in Rust, focused on performance and security. The Nexus zkVM starts with the user providing a normal Rust program. After compiling, it runs the program, generating a trace of its execution. The zkVM then produces a succinct, efficiently verifiable proof that the output of the program was correctly generated by its execution.
2. Layer 1 Blockchain
The Nexus Layer 1 is more than a protocol — it's a programmable foundation for building the next generation of verifiable applications.
Getting Started: Three Ways to Participate
Option 1: Web Application (Easiest for Beginners)
Step 1: Create Your Nexus Wallet

1. Visit the Nexus app in any browser. There are no downloads, plugins, or extensions to worry about. Everything you need to get started is built right into the site.
2. On the homepage, you'll find a clearly labeled button to "Sign up" in the right hand corner. Click it to begin the onboarding process.
3. You can sign up using your email address or a Google account.
4. Once you've logged in, your wallet is ready to go. It's fully self-custodial, meaning you control it, and it lives onchain, ready to be used with apps across the Nexus ecosystem and beyond.

Step 2: Start Contributing

1. Visit app.nexus.xyz
2. Follow the account linking instructions. Your contributions will earn NEX Points.
3. Track your progress on the leaderboard. Manage all your nodes in one place.

Option 2: Command Line Interface (CLI)
The Nexus Command-Line Interface (CLI) is the fastest on-ramp for contributing compute to the world supercomputer.
Installation Steps:

1. Visit docs.nexus.xyz for the official installation guide
2. Download the CLI binary
3. It's just as easy to get started — download the CLI from the docs, run a simple install command, and you're computing.

For Linux/Ubuntu users:
```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev git-all
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler
```
# Install Rust
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc
```
# Install Nexus CLI
```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```
# Running the CLI:
```bash
nexus-network start --node-id <Your-id>
```
Once setup is complete, launch the CLI interactive mode to immediately requests its first task: nexus-network start
Benefits of CLI:

* The CLI unlocks scale and flexibility. While the web app is super easy to use, the CLI really enables our power users to optimize how they connect to the Nexus network — providing more compute or multiple nodes beyond what they could do in-browser.
* You can connect as many devices as you want, including desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and servers. You can also prove computations in multiple browser tabs simultaneously.

Option 3: Development and Building Apps
Example Applications to Start With:
Whether you're exploring token workflows, experimenting with NFTs, or designing trust-minimized compute flows, the new Layer 1 example apps offer concrete, production-minded patterns to start from: Default lock/retrieve app A foundational contract that allows users to lock tokens and retrieve them later — ideal for onboarding flows, staking contracts, or time-bound actions. This app features a comprehensive end-to-end tutorial that walks developers through building, deploying, and testing while introducing key L1 development concepts along the way.
Additional Example Apps:

* Counter app: A minimal example that demonstrates how to manage state transitions on Nexus Layer 1. Perfect for first-time builders looking to understand how persistent state works in a verifiable execution environment.
* NFT platform app: A fully working NFT system, including minting, ownership tracking, and metadata handling.

Technical Specifications
zkVM 3.0 Features
Based around a revamped guest runtime, fast memory checking, and backended by the Stwo prover from StarkWare, zkVM 3.0 is more usable, more extensible, and ~1000x faster than previous releases.
Programming Language Support

* The zkVM can prove RISC-V programs compiled from any high-level language. A Rust runtime and SDK make developing for the zkVM as simple as writing code for any other application.
* 70% of the top 1,000 Rust crates work with their zkVM without any additional configuration.

Performance
As the engine of our supercomputer, it helped Testnet II achieve 112 quadrillion FLOPS of power and a peak speed of 60.4 million verifiable Hz.
Rewards and Incentives

* You earn NEX Points by contributing compute and interacting with the Nexus ecosystem.
* At this time, contributors receive recognition through public leaderboards. Nexus may implement additional incentives in a future release.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
Network reachability — Ports 443 and 8443 must reach orchestrator.nexus.xyz. Out-of-date binary — Run the install command to get the latest CLI release. Hardware limits — Laptops may throttle under sustained load. Use --max-threads or point the CLI at a beefier server.
Getting Help

* Search existing GitHub issues or open a new one. Drop by the Discord #nexus-prover-faq channel.
* Start building at docs.nexus.xyz and join the conversation in Discord. Connect with us on X and Discord.

Important Security Notes
Staff from the Dynamic or the Nexus team will never ask for your login codes or secrets. If you get a request like that, it's likely a scam and should be reported.
Current Status
The Nexus zkVM is in an experimental stage and is not currently recommended for production use. However, it's actively being developed and improved.
Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred method (Web App, CLI, or Development)
2. Many users start in the browser to learn the ropes and graduate to the CLI once they're comfortable.
3. Join the community channels for support and updates
4. Start contributing compute to earn NEX Points
5. Explore building applications on the Nexus Layer 1
